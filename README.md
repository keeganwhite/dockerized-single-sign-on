# dockerized-single-sign-on

## Overview

Portions of this code were withdrawn from the [iNethi environment](https://github.com/iNethi/master-builder) where this will be integrated to provide single sign-on services for iNethi deployments. If you don't want to run any auth services you can use [these](https://github.com/iNethi/master-builder/tree/master/traefik-with-dnsmasq) scripts to build a reverse-proxy and dns service for a server.
